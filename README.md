# Loan Approval Analysis

This repo contains notebooks analyzes bank data to determine loan eleigibility for applicants based on the default rate and approval rate of previous loans.
There are two notebooks that look at these features and also dig in various techniques to construct models.

The problem with such datasets is that very small number of applicants either get approved or default on their loans. Additionally a large number of features (data) collected does not really contribute to model or can cause severe colliner behavior making a careful analysis necessary to get a meaningful model.
